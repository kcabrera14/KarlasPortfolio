					<h3>Northrop Grumman</h3>
					<p>I was one of six students selected to work on a Robotics Development Project at Northrop Grumman. This project consisted of making and programming a robot that would have the ability to pick up and stack cones. We also had to implement an autonomous mode on the robot. Overall, I was able to obtain exposure to Northrop Grumman products and programs. As a mentee, I was able to gain mentorship from Northrop Grumman employees and exposure to the workforce.

					<h3>Spikes Game</h3>
					<p>During my Open Source class at CSUF, we had the opportunity to create an open source project. We decided to use GoDot which is a 2D and 3D, cross-platform, free and open-source game engine released under the MIT license. In order create the graphics of our project we used Blender. Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality, and computer games.

				<h3>GitHub Timeline</h3>
				<p>
				This software project was part of my CPSC 362 Software Development Course. We created a display of a users Github activity and history in a timline view. Our group decided to use Agile methodology and deliver in increments. We used REACT JS, Github REST API V3, and Github GraphQL API V4 to create this project. Overall, this timeline becomes extremely useful for any user who wants to share past and current projects with future employers.  </p>
